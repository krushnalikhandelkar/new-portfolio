    "Web Page Languages: A Quick Introduction" <br>
    Web page languages are vital for dynamic websites. Each serves a unique purpose. Here's a snapshot: <br>
    1. HTML (Skeleton): Defines the structure. <br>
    2.CSS (Style): Adds aesthetics. <br>
    3. JavaScript (Functionality): Provides interactivity. Just like the body's skeleton, muscles, and  <br>nerves work together, these languages collaborate to bring websites to life. <br>
    Text editors are essential tools for web development because they provide a streamlined environment  <br>for writing and editing code with features like syntax highlighting, code completion and plugin  <br>support. Popular text editors include Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, and Atom. <br>
    Why I chose VS code? <br>
    Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is favoured for web development due to its robust features, fast  <br>performance, cross-platform support, extensive customization options, and vibrant ecosystem, making  <br>it a top choice among developers. <br>
    </p>

<h2>Day 1</h2>
    <p>
        
        The inaugural module was a deep dive into web development essentials. We explored the trifecta  <br>of HTML, CSS, and JS, laying the groundwork for crafting captivating digital experience. <br>
        What is HTML? <br>
        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for  <br>creating web pages. It's a markup language used to structure content on the web, defining  <br>elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML forms the backbone of web content.  <br>In layman's terms, HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells  <br>a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it <br> as the building blocks that create the structure and look of a website, similar to how bricks  <br>and mortar are used to build a house. <br>
        In a nutshell: <br>
        HTML is the language of the web, used to create websites. <br>
        HTML defines the barebone structure or layout of web pages that we see on the Internet. <br>
        HTML consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files  <br>typically have either a ".html" or ".html" extension. <br>
        There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version. <br>
         (Assignment no.1)  <br>
        Build the  form using form tag etc. <br>
        <!-- <a href="../module1/ssimg/ssform.png">Click Here</a><br>
        <a href="../module1/ssimg/ssf.png">Click Here</a> -->
        <img style="height: 2oopx;width: 700px;" src="./ssimg/ssform.png" alt="">
        <img style="height: 2oopx;width: 700px;" src="./ssimg/ssf.png" alt="">
         <br>
        (Assignment no.2) <br>
        Build your own class time table using table tags etc. <br>
        <img style="height: 2oopx;width: 700px;" src="./ssimg/sstable.png" alt="">
        <img style="height: 2oopx;width: 700px;" src="./ssimg/sst.png" alt="">

<h2>Day 2
</h2>
<p>"HTML Dive & CSS " is a metaphorical expression used to describe the process of learning and  <br>mastering HTML and CSS, the two fundamental languages of web development. <br>
- HTML Dive: This refers to delving deeply into HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is the standard  <br>markup language for creating web pages. HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, defining  <br>elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. <br>
- CSS : CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and format HTML elements, enhancing the visual  <br>presentation of a web page. A CSS "kickstart" implies getting started or initiating the process of  <br>learning CSS, which involves understanding selectors, properties, values, and how to apply styles to  <br>different elements.  <br>
together, mastering HTML and CSS forms the foundation of web design and development, enabling  <br>individuals to create visually appealing and well-structured websites. <br>
(Assignment no.3)  <br>

Style the buttons using hover, gradient, all font properties, and in creative way. <br>

<img style="height: 2oopx;width: 700px;" src="./ssimg/ssr.png" alt=""> 



<br>
 <h2>Day 3 </h2><br>
<p>
    Advanced CSS encompasses a range of techniques and concepts that go beyond basic styling. It includes <br> topics like Flexbox and Grid layout for advanced page structuring, media queries for responsive design, <br> CSS animations and transitions for adding interactivity, CSS preprocessors like Sass for enhanced code  <br>organization, and CSS variables for dynamic styling. Additionally, it covers topics like vendor prefixes  <br>for cross-browser compatibility and performance optimization techniques. Mastering advanced CSS empowers  <br>developers to create more complex and visually appealing web experiences. <br>
(Assignment no.4)  <br>
1)Try to create a static web page displaying current time and date on clicking on the button. Also try  <br>to add World Clock on the same website. <br>
2)Make it creative and attractive using gradient, hover, background images, etc. <br>
3) Try to explore more about Java script. <br>

</div>

 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h2>Day 4</h2> <br>
<p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic  <br>functionality to websites. It runs on the client side, meaning it executes in the user's web browser,  <br>enabling actions such as form validation, animations, and updating content without reloading the page.  <br>JavaScript is also used on the server side with platforms like Node.js. It's essential for modern web  <br>development and is supported by all major browsers, making it a fundamental skill for front-end and  <br>full-stack developers. <br>
    (Assignment no.5)  <br>
    1)Try to create a static web page displaying current time and date on clicking on the button. Also try to add World Clock on the same website.
    2)Make it creative and attractive using gradient, hover, background images, etc.
    3) Try to explore more about Javascript. <br></p>

    <h2>Day 5 </h2>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software <br> development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on projects simultaneously, facilitating  <br>seamless code integration and management. Git tracks changes to files, enabling developers to revert to  <br>previous versions, compare changes, and merge code branches efficiently. <br>
    GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a platform  <br>for developers to store, share, and collaborate on projects using Git. GitHub offers additional features  <br>such as issue tracking, pull requests, code reviews, and project management tools, making it a popular  <br>choice for open-source and collaborative software development. <br>
    In summary, Git is the version control system, while GitHub is a hosting service built around Git,  <br>providing a platform for collaborative development and project management. <br></p>
